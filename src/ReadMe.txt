TODO: 
Entities->HandleSpriteFile(), perhaps have a class to setup that animation (takes sprite file, sets up anim from file text?)
This routine will load all the default sprites that are passed very frequently, improves readability and maintainability. ***


Have it take pub_01.mp3 instead of pub_01.wav to save 14MB of RAM


Enemies need spritesheet of attack anim..

Work out the entire framework for the engine, i.e. maps, npcs, sprites, inventory and so forth that needs to be taken into account for an RPG.
Levels should be worked out via a text file also (to improve readability).
More NPC/Level creation..
More SFX/Quest Dialogs, a generic dialog class needs to be created along with a generic class that allows key input properly.
loot->Draw() should be loot->DrawAllLoot().
Get Enemy AI Pathing working with enemy hitting dmg.
Further revise RAM usage, look into FPS problems on lower hardware..


RANK ALL THESE FEATURES INTO PRIORITY LEVELS AND GO TO WORK ON IT.
